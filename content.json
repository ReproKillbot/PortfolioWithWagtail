The bridge is covered with mossy stones, and would be a tight fit for any serious wagon. Anyone moving at more than half speed will be forced to roll an Acrobatics check with a DC of 5 to successfully make it without falling prone. A roll of a 1 will result in the character falling to the rocks below...</p><p>Characters who fall into the river will roll a d6+1, the amount rolled will be the number of falling damage the character takes from falling to the river. Successful Athletics checks will be needed to stay afloat or to pull themselves out of the river. Have them roll Perception as they fall, a 15 or higher will reveal a knotted rope leading up to the toll booth. A hidden cove down the river leads to one of 3 entrances to the Thieves Hideout - a knotted rope dangling into a shallow pool leads to a small ledge with a swollen, wooden door.</p><p><b>Dynamics</b></p><p>The toll station is guarded by 3 well-armed and wary Guards. Above the cliffs, 4 thieves lay in wait, awaiting a juicy mark to cross. The lieutenant is on the take, and the youngest thief is the son of the Farmer.</p><p>The guard captain is a cantankerous, grubby man who is happy to lie about the cost of the toll to line his own pockets. If the players are anything but deferential, his fee doubles to 4gp (He splits the 2 extra gold with his companions). If the players start any sort of altercation or argument, the thieves up top take advantage of the chaos to climb the hidden rope and steal from the Guards as they are distracted. If the players are attempting to sneak past - keep in mind they are rolling for both the Guards and the Thieves (Use the average passive perception of either party). It&#x27;s possible they sneak by the guards and get blackmailed by the Thieves!</p><p><b>Thematics</b></p><p>Sound Effects:</p><ul><li>Waterfall Noize<br/></li></ul><p>Preparation:</p><ul><li>Stat
